## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Networks of biomedical data are subject to both false positives and false negatives, meaning that entities rarely have all their true connections represented in any given network.
Deviations from true connections are often biased with respect to node degree, due to a variety of processes including inspection bias and experimental methods.
While degree is subject to potentially substantial biases, link prediction methods can be strongly affected by degree.
In the present work, we demonstrate the 

In the present work, we introduce a network permutation method that accounts for the biases of node degree and can generate "corrected" features that account for the effect of degree.
Fine-grained counterfactual distributions are found by producing degree-preserving permutations of a network with biased degree and applying link prediction methods to permutations as well as the true network.
Each node pair feature can then be adjusted relative to values it takes when only node degree is preserved.
This correction can cause features to become decorrelated with degree and enables unsupervised predictions of edges derived through systematic, degree-bias-free means.
Finally, we present a permutation-derived link prediction feature that shows excellent performance for some tasks and is a suitable baseline for link prediction in directed, undirected, bipartite, and multipartite networks.
