## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Important tasks in biology and biomedicine such as predicting gene functions, gene-disease associations, and drug repurposing opportunities are often framed as network edge prediction.
Degree strongly influences edge prediction, and degree biases and degree imbalance can lead to nonspecific predictions.
We introduce a network permutation framework to quantify the effect of node degree on network-based methods and prediction tasks.
As part of this we define an edge prior to quantify the probability that two nodes are connected based only on their degree.
After demonstrating that this prior feature shows excellent discrimination and calibration performance for 20 different biomedical networks (16 bipartite, 3 undirected, 1 directed), we conclude that our prior feature represents a suitable baseline for network link prediction tasks, as performance exceeding the baseline is attributable to factors other than degree alone.
Additionally, we propose methods to incorporate network permutation and the edge prior into other predictive methods.
Our results highlight the importance of degree for link prediction and provide software to account for its effects when degree bias may be present.
We have released a full implementation of our network permutation method and the edge prior as an open-source Python package on GitHub and the Python Package Index.
