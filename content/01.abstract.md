## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Inspection bias generates node degree bias in networks of biomedical data.
Well-studied entities appear to have relatively higher numbers of relationships than poorly-studied entities that may have a similar number of true relationships.
This bias can manifest in varying magnitude between networks.
While degree is subject to potentially significant biases, link-prediction methods are often strongly correlated with degree.
This motivates the present work, in which we present a network permutation method that accounts for the biases of node degree and can generate "corrected" features that account for the effect of degree.
Fine-grained counterfactual distributions are found by producing degree-preserving permutations of a network with biased degree and applying link prediction methods to permutations as well as the true network.
Each node pair feature can then be adjusted relative to values it takes when only node degree is preserved.
This correction can cause features to become decorrelated with degree and enables unsupervised predictions of edges derived through systematic, degree-bias-free means.
Finally, we present a permutation-derived link prediction feature that shows excellent performance for some tasks and is a suitable baseline for link prediction in directed, undirected, bipartite, and multipartite networks.
