## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Networks of biomedical data are subject to both false positives and false negatives, meaning that entities rarely have all their true connections represented in any given network.
Deviations from true connections are often biased with respect to node degree, due to a variety of processes including inspection bias and experimental methods.
While degree is subject to potentially substantial biases, link prediction methods can be strongly affected by degree.
In the present work, we introduce a network permutation framework to quantify the effect of node degree on network-based methods.
Our method can be used to find the prior probability of an individual link's existence that is attributable exclusively to the network's degree sequence.
After demonstrating that this prior feature shows excellent performance for some prediction tasks, we conclude that our prior feature represents a suitable baseline for network link prediction methods, as performance exceeding the baseline is attributable to factors other than degree alone.
