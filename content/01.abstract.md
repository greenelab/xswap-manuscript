## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Node degree can strongly influence many network-based inference methods like clustering, link prediction, and node ranking.
In fact, some methods produce features that are so strongly influenced by degree that their performance in their intended applications is indistinguishable from features derived exclusively from node degree.
Some inference methods intend to rely on node degree, while other methods are confounded by it.
We use degree-preserving network randomization to build a framework for considering the effects (whether intended or unintended) of node degree on network link-prediction methods.

`Above paragraph should include a mention of the degree bias in data themselves.`

The method we propose is generalizable to many network prediction and inference tasks.
A feature-extraction method can be applied to a network, and its performance can be compared to a `?meaningful?` counterfactual distribution via permuted networks.
The application of methods both to real and to permuted networks allows one to quantify the method's performance that is attributable to the effect of degree alone.

We find that constructed features that take the counterfactual condition into account can be decorrelated with node degree `Figure 2?`, allowing predictive performance on new datasets to be improved `Figure 3?` and predictions to be less biased. `Could quantify "bias" as dissimilarity to unbiased??`
In particular, when translating a predictive method from a biased degree network to making predictions on a network without degree bias, performance is increased.
