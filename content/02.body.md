## Introduction

Networks contain information about relationships between entities ("edges between nodes").
One key aspect of a node (especially in unweighted networks) is its degree, the number of connections a node makes with other nodes in the network.
Degree is an important metric for differentiating between nodes.
However, reliance on degree may not always be desirable.
Firstly, bias in the data can distort node degree.
Secondly, an unexamined reliance on degree can lead edge prediction methods to make nonspecific or trivial predictions and fail to identify novel or insightful relationships.
We sought to understand the effect of node degree on edge prediction methods.
In this paper, we introduce a permutation-based framework to find edge existence probabilities due to node degree and to quantify the contribution of degree to edge prediction methods.

Most biomedical data networks are imperfect representations of the true set of relationships.
Real networks often mistakenly include edges that do not exist and exclude edges that do exist.
How well a network represents the true relationships it attempts to represent depends on a number of factors, especially the methods used to generate the data in the network [@doi:10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.020; @doi:10.3389/fgene.2015.00260; @doi:10.1038/nbt1116].
We define "degree bias" as the type of misrepresentation that occurs when the fraction of incorrectly existent/nonexistent relationships depends on degree.
Inspection bias indicates that entities are not uniformly studied [@doi:10.1038/nature04209], and it is likely to cause degree bias when networks are constructed using hypothesis-driven findings extracted from the literature, as newly-discovered relationships are not randomly sampled from the set of all true relationships.

For example, the number of publications mentioning a gene has little correlation with its degree in a systematically-derived protein interaction network [Figure 6A in @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.050].
Therefore, the high correlation between number of publications and degree in low-throughput interaction networks is almost entirely the result of inspection bias.
This evidence suggests that many poorly studied genes have similar numbers of interactions as the genes scientists have preferentially examined.
Depending on the type of data being represented, degree biases can also arise due to experimental methods or other factors [@doi:10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.020].
The consequence of degree bias is that a difference in degree between two nodes may not reflect a difference in the number of true edges.
Reliance on degree may be unfavorable depending on the prediction/analysis task being conducted and the magnitude of possible degree bias in the data.

Another reason why a method's reliance on degree can be unfavorable is that degree imbalance can lead to prediction nonspecificity.
Nonspecific predictions are based on information that, while potentially associated with true connections, does not reflect the underlying causal relationships.
For example, Gillis et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017258] examined the concept of prediction specificity in the context of gene function prediction and found that many predictions appear to rely primarily on multifunctionality and could be "potentially misleading with respect to causality."
Real networks have a variety of degree distributions (Figure {@fig:hetionet}), and they commonly exhibit degree imbalance [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017645; @doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-361-5_13; @doi:10.1038/s41467-019-08746-5].
Degree imbalance leads high-degree nodes to dominate in the predictions made by degree-associated methods [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv215], which are effective predictors of connections in some biological networks [@doi:10.1186/1752-0509-2-11].

![Degree distribution can vary greatly between networks, even between the source and target degree distributions within the same network.
  Shown are seven degree distributions of six networks from Hetionet [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726].
  (The final two are the source and target distributions of a single network.)

Consequently, degree-based predictions are more likely nonspecific, meaning the same set of predictions performs well for different tasks.
However, depending on the prediction task, edge predictions between very high degree nodes may be undesired, uninsightful, or nonspecific.
Model evaluation is challenging in this context, as nonspecific or trivial predictions need not be incorrect, even if they are not the desired outputs of the predictive model.
For example, predicting that the highest degree node in a network shares edges with the remaining nodes to which it is not connected will often lead to many correct predictions, despite the predictions being generic to all nodes in the network.
To clarify the situation, degree-based features must be included in the interpretation of predictions in order to disentangle desired from non-desired effects and to more effectively evaluate and compare predictive models.


## Methods

### Network permutation

Network permutation is a way to produce new networks by randomizing the connections of an existing network.
Specialized permutation strategies can be devised that permute networks while retaining chosen features.
Comparing between permuted and unpermuted networks gives insight to the effects of the retained network features.
For example, an edge prediction method that has superior reconstruction performance on a network compared to its permutations likely relies on information that is eliminated in permutation.
Conversely, identical predictive performance on true and permuted networks indicates that a method relies on information that is preserved during permutation.
Network permutation is a flexible framework for analyzing other methods, because it generates networks with identical formats to the original network.
We propose using network permutation to isolate degree and determine its effects in different contexts.
Degree-preserving network permutation obscures true connections and higher-order connectivity information while retaining node degree, and thereby, the network's degree sequence.
Thanks to the flexibility of permutation, our framework can quantify the effect of degree on any network edge prediction method.

### XSwap algorithm

Hanhijärvi, et al. presented XSwap [@doi:10.1137/1.9781611972795.67], an algorithm for the randomization ("permutation") of unweighted networks (Figure {@fig:algo}A).
The algorithm picks two existing edges at random, and if the edges constitute a valid swap, exchanges the targets between the edges (Figure {@fig:xswap}).

![Graphical representation of the XSwap algorithm applied to two edges.
The algorithm preserves both the source- and target-degree for all nodes.](images/xswap_figure.png){#fig:xswap width="50%"}

To allow greater flexibility, we modified the algorithm by adding two parameters, "`allow_self_loops`", and "`allow_antiparallel`" that allow a greater variety of network types to be permuted (Figure {@fig:algo}B).
Specifically, two chosen edges constitute a valid swap if they preserve degree for all four involved nodes and do not violate the above condition options.
The motivation for these generalizations is to make the permutation method applicable both to directed and undirected graphs, as well as to networks with different types of nodes, variously called multipartite, heterogeneous, or multimodal networks.
We provide documentation for parameter choices depending on the type of network being permuted in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/hetio/xswap).
The original algorithm and our proposed modification are given in Figure {@fig:algo}.

### Edge prior

We introduce the "edge prior" to quantify the probability that two nodes are connected based only on their degree.
The edge prior can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimate for the binomial distribution success probability--the fraction of permuted networks in which a given edge exists.
Based only on permuted networks, the edge prior does not contain any information about the true edges in the (unpermuted) network.
The edge prior is a numerical feature that can be computed for each node pair in a network, and we compared its ability to predict edges in three tasks, discussed below.

### Edge prior approximation

We also considered the possibility that the probability of an edge existing across permuted networks could be written as a closed form equation involving the node pair's degree.
We were unable to find a closed-form solution giving the edge prior without assuming independent node pairs, which we believe is incorrect for XSwap.
Nonetheless, we discovered a good approximation to the edge prior for networks with many nodes and relatively low edge density.

Let $m$ be the total number of edge in the network, and $d(u_i)$, $d(v_j)$ be the source and target degrees of a node pair, respectively.
A good approximation of the edge prior is given by the following:
\begin{equation}
    P_{i,j} = \frac{d(u_i) d(v_j)}{\sqrt{(d(u_i) d(v_j))^2 + (m - d(u_i) - d(v_j) + 1)^2}}
\end{equation}

Further discussion of this approximate edge prior and an derivation are available in [the supplement](#approx-prior-supp).

### Prediction tasks

We performed three prediction tasks to assess the performance of the edge prior, and we compared two additional features, a scaled product of source and target degree (scaled to the range [0, 1]), and our approximation of the edge prior.
For the first two prediction tasks, we used 20 biomedical networks from the Hetionet heterogeneous network [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726] that had at minimum 2000 edges.
In the first task, we computed the degree-based prediction features (edge prior, scaled degree product, and prior approximation), and predicted the original edges in the network.
Negative samples in the first task were node pairs in which an edge was not present in the original network.
To assess the methods' predictive performances, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for all three features.
In the second task, we sampled 70% of edges from each of the networks, computed features on the sampled network, then attempted to predict held-out edges.
For this task, negative samples were node pairs in which an edge did not exist in either original or sampled network, while positive samples were only those node pairs without an edge in the sampled network but with an edge in the original network.

The third task evaluated the ability of the edge prior to generalize to new degree distributions.
We used two domains--protein-protein interactions (PPI) and transcription factor-target gene (TF-TG) relationships--where networks are available that were generated through different methods: literature curation of low-throughput, hypothesis-driven research and high-throughput, systematic, hypothesis-free experimentation.
For the PPI networks, we used the STRING network, which incorporates literature-mining to find relationships [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1131] and a combination of the high-throughput, proteome-scale interaction networks due to Rual et al. [@doi:10.1038/nature04209] and Rolland et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.050].
We used a transcription factor-target gene (TF-TG) literature-derived network from Han et al. [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx1013] and a high-throughput network from Lachmann et al. [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq466].
For both the PPI and TF-TG data sources, we had two networks, one in which we expect degree bias and one in which we do not.

As a further basis of comparison, we added a time-resolved co-authorship network which we partitioned by time to create two separate networks.
The co-authorship network represented bioRxiv preprints, and it was created using the Rxivist [@doi:10.1101/515643; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.2566421] database that was generated by crawling the bioRxiv server.
Unlike the other two, the co-authorship network does not have degree bias, as the network faithfully represents all true co-author relationships.
We include this network to offer a comparative prediction task in which the degree distributions between training (posted before 2018) and testing (posted during or after 2018) do not differ (Figure {@fig:degree-bias}A).
The goal of the third prediction task is to determine feature generalizability for network reconstruction between different degree distributions, especially predicting a network without degree bias using features from a degree-biased network.
Further information about the networks used can be found in [the supplement](#networks).

### Degree-grouping

Our method for degree-preserving permutation switches almost all edges in the network.
Because only degree is preserved, nodes with equal degree can be grouped when summarizing features.
For example, in link prediction methods, two node pairs with the same source and target degree have link prediction feature values in permuted networks that are drawn from the same distribution.
Each node pair's feature values in permuted networks can be augmented in this way to have more permuted feature values than permuted networks.
For nodes with a common degree, degree grouping can greatly increase the effective number of permutations, even though only a smaller number of permuted networks were generated.
We utilized degree grouping throughout our analysis, including in computing the edge prior.

### Implementation and source code

We implemented the modified XSwap algorithm as a Python package, with the actual edge swap mechanism implemented in C++ for greater speed.
In addition to functions that permute networks (represented as edge lists), the package contains utilities for computing the edge prior, converting a network between adjacency matrix and edge list formats, and for assigning unique identifiers to nodes.
The Python package is available on the Python Packaging Index under the name "xswap".
The full source code for our method of degree-preserving network permutation has also been made freely available ([https://github.com/hetio/xswap](https://github.com/hetio/xswap)), as has the code for the analysis, figure generation ([https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-analysis](https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-analysis)), and manuscript ([https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-manuscript](https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-manuscript)).
