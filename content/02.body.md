## Methods

### Network permutation

Network permutation is a way to produce new networks by randomizing the connections of an existing network.
Specialized permutation strategies can be devised that permute networks while retaining chosen features.
Comparing between permuted and unpermuted networks gives insight to the effects of the retained network features.
For example, an edge prediction method that has superior reconstruction performance on a network compared to its permutations likely relies on information that is eliminated in permutation.
Conversely, identical predictive performance on true and permuted networks indicates that a method relies on information that is preserved during permutation.
Network permutation is a flexible framework for analyzing other methods, because it generates networks with identical formats to the original network.
We propose using network permutation to isolate degree and determine its effects in different contexts.
Degree-preserving network permutation obscures true connections and higher-order connectivity information while retaining node degree, and thereby, the network's degree sequence.
Thanks to the flexibility of permutation, our framework can quantify the effect of degree on any network edge prediction method.

### XSwap algorithm

Hanhijärvi, et al. presented XSwap [@doi:10.1137/1.9781611972795.67], an algorithm for the randomization ("permutation") of unweighted networks (Figure {@fig:algo}A).
The algorithm picks two existing edges at random, and if the edges constitute a valid swap, exchanges the targets between the edges (Figure {@fig:xswap}).

The algorithm preserves both the source- and target-degree for all nodes.](images/xswap_figure.png){#fig:xswap width="50%"}

To allow greater flexibility, we modified the algorithm by adding two parameters, "`allow_self_loops`", and "`allow_antiparallel`" that allow a greater variety of network types to be permuted (Figure {@fig:algo}B).
Specifically, two chosen edges constitute a valid swap if they preserve degree for all four involved nodes and do not violate the above condition options.
The motivation for these generalizations is to make the permutation method applicable both to directed and undirected graphs, as well as to networks with different types of nodes, variously called multipartite, heterogeneous, or multimodal networks.
We provide documentation for parameter choices depending on the type of network being permuted in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/hetio/xswap).
The original algorithm and our proposed modification are given in Figure {@fig:algo}.

### Edge prior

We introduce the "edge prior" to quantify the probability that two nodes are connected based only on their degree.
The edge prior can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimate for the binomial distribution success probability--the fraction of permuted networks in which a given edge exists.
Based only on permuted networks, the edge prior does not contain any information about the true edges in the (unpermuted) network.
The edge prior is a numerical feature that can be computed for each node pair in a network, and we compared its ability to predict edges in three tasks, discussed below.

### Edge prior approximation

We also considered the possibility that the probability of an edge existing across permuted networks could be written as a closed form equation involving the node pair's degree.
We were unable to find a closed-form solution giving the edge prior without assuming independent node pairs, which we believe is incorrect for XSwap.
Nonetheless, we discovered a good approximation to the edge prior for networks with many nodes and relatively low edge density.

Let $m$ be the total number of edge in the network, and $d(u_i)$, $d(v_j)$ be the source and target degrees of a node pair, respectively.
A good approximation of the edge prior is given by the following:
\begin{equation}
    P_{i,j} = \frac{d(u_i) d(v_j)}{\sqrt{(d(u_i) d(v_j))^2 + (m - d(u_i) - d(v_j) + 1)^2}}
\end{equation}

Further discussion of this approximate edge prior and an derivation are available in [the supplement](#approx-prior-supp).

### Prediction tasks

### Degree-grouping

Our method for degree-preserving permutation produces randomized networks that share few of their edges with the original network.
The feature values for two node pairs with the same source and target degree are drawn from the same distribution in permuted networks, so nodes with equal degree can be grouped when summarizing features.
We used this to augment each node pair's feature values in permuted networks, which allowed these pairs to have more permuted feature values than permuted networks.
Degree grouping greatly increased the effective number of permutations for nodes with frequently observed degrees [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/hetmech/pull/96].
We used degree grouping throughout our analyses.

### Implementation and source code

We implemented the modified XSwap algorithm as a Python package, with the actual edge swap mechanism implemented in C++ for greater speed.
In addition to functions that permute networks (represented as edge lists), the package contains utilities for computing the edge prior, converting a network between adjacency matrix and edge list formats, and for assigning unique identifiers to nodes.
The Python package is available on the Python Packaging Index under the name "xswap".
The full source code for our method of degree-preserving network permutation has also been made freely available ([https://github.com/hetio/xswap](https://github.com/hetio/xswap)), as has the code for the analysis, figure generation ([https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-analysis](https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-analysis)), and manuscript ([https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-manuscript](https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-manuscript)).
