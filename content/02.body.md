## Introduction

### Node degree

Networks contain information about relationships between entities ("edges between nodes").
One key aspect of a node (especially in unweighted networks) is its degree, the number of connections a node makes with other nodes in the network.
Degree is an important metric for differentiating between nodes and it is heavily relied-upon by a number of edge prediction (also known as "link prediction") features (Figure {@fig:feature-degree}).
However, reliance on degree may not always be desirable.
Firstly, degree may be a source of bias in networks.
Secondly, an over-reliance on degree can lead edge prediction methods to make nonspecific or trivial predictions  that fail to identify novel or insightful relationships.
We are interested in assessing the effect of node degree on edge prediction methods.
In particular, we introduce a permutation-based framework to find edge existence probabilities due to node degree and to quantify the contribution of degree to edge prediction methods.

Most biomedical data networks are imperfect representations of the true set of relationships.
Real networks often mistakenly include edges that do not exist and exclude edges that do exist.
How well a network represents the true relationships it attempts to represent depends on a number of factors, especially the methods used to generate the data in the network [@doi:10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.020; @doi:10.3389/fgene.2015.00260].
We define "degree bias" as the type of misrepresentation that occurs when the fraction of incorrectly existent/nonexistent relationships depends on degree.
Inspection bias indicates that entities are not uniformly studied [@doi:10.1038/nature04209], and it is likely to cause degree bias when networks are constructed using hypothesis-driven findings extracted from the literature, as newly-discovered relationships are not randomly sampled from the set of all true relationships.
The presence of inspection bias in a network means that well-studied entities have a higher fraction of their true relationships represented than less well-studied entities.
Depending on the type of data being represented, degree biases can also arise due to experimental methods or other factors [@doi:10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.020].
Figure {@fig:degree-bias}A-C illustrates the problem of degree bias by showing node degree in separate networks for the same type of data.
Depending on the methods by which the represented data were generated, networks of the same type of data may assign very different degree to the same nodes, and they may have overall degree distributions that differ greatly.
The consequence of degree bias is that a difference in degree between two nodes may not reflect a difference in the number of true edges.
Reliance on degree may be unfavorable depending on the prediction/analysis task being conducted and the magnitude of possible degree bias in the data.

Another reason why a reliance on degree can be unfavorable is that degree-based predictions may be nonspecific.
Nonspecific predictions are based on information that, while potentially associated with true connections, is not reflective of the underlying causal relationships.
For example, predicting that the highest degree node in a network shares edges with the remaining nodes to which it is not connected will often lead to many correct predictions, despite the fact that the predictions were generic to all nodes in the network.
Gillis et al. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017258] explored the concept of prediction specificity with respect to gene function prediction, in which predictions based on gene multifunctionality could be, "potentially misleading with respect to causality."
The authors found that, "[N]ode degree is unambiguously linked to multifunctionality," and proposed that, "[T]here are no computational gene function assignments that can be shown to preclude the possibility they reflect only underlying multifunctionality."
We believe gene multifunctionality is an instance of the more general issue of edge prediction nonspecificity due to node degree.

Real networks have a variety of degree distributions, and they commonly exhibit degree imbalance [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017645; @doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-361-5_13; @doi:10.1038/s41467-019-08746-5].
Figure {@fig:degree-bias}D shows examples of different degree distributions in six biomedical networks.
Degree imbalance leads high-degree nodes to dominate in the predictions made by degree-associated methods [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv215], which have been shown to be effective predictors of connections in some biological networks [@doi:10.1186/1752-0509-2-11].
Consequently, degree-based predictions are more likely nonspecific, meaning the same set of predictions would appear to perform well for different tasks.
However, depending on the prediction task and the desired types of predictions, edge predictions between very high degree nodes may be uninsightful or nonspecific.
Model evaluation can also be complicated, as nonspecific or trivial predictions need not be incorrect, even if they are not the desired outputs of the predictive model.
Rather, degree-based features must be included in the interpretation of predictions in order to disentangle desired from non-desired effects and to more effectively evaluate and compare predictive models.

## Methods

### Network permutation

### XSwap algorithm

Hanhijärvi, et al. presented XSwap [@doi:10.1137/1.9781611972795.67], an algorithm for the randomization ("permutation") of unweighted networks (Figure {@fig:algo}A).
The algorithm picks two existing edges at random, and if the edges constitute a valid swap, exchanges the targets between the edges (Figure {@fig:xswap}).

![Graphical representation of the XSwap algorithm applied to two edges.
The algorithm preserves both the source- and target-degree for all nodes.](images/xswap_figure.png){#fig:xswap width="50%"}

To allow greater flexibility, we modified the algorithm by adding two parameters, "`allow_self_loops`", and "`allow_antiparallel`" that allow a greater variety of network types to be permuted (Figure {@fig:algo}B).
Specifically, two chosen edges constitute a valid swap if they preserve degree for all four involved nodes and do not violate the above condition options.
The motivation for these generalizations is to make the permutation method applicable both to directed and undirected graphs, as well as to networks with different types of nodes, variously called multipartite, heterogeneous, or multimodal networks.
We provide documentation for parameter choices depending on the type of network being permuted in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/hetio/xswap).
The original algorithm and our proposed modification are given in Figure {@fig:algo}.

### Edge prior

We introduce the "edge prior" to quantify the probability that two nodes are connected based only on their degree.
The edge prior can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimate for the binomial distribution success probability--the fraction of permuted networks in which a given edge exists.
Based only on permuted networks, the edge prior does not contain any information about the true edges in the (unpermuted) network.
The edge prior is a numerical feature that can be computed for each node pair in a network, and we compared its ability to predict edges in three tasks, discussed below.

### Edge prior approximation

We also considered the possibility that the probability of an edge existing across permuted networks could be written as a closed form equation involving the node pair's degree.
We were unable to find a closed-form solution giving the edge prior without assuming independent node pairs, which we believe is incorrect for XSwap.
Nonetheless, we discovered a good approximation to the edge prior for networks with many nodes and relatively low edge density.

Let $m$ be the total number of edge in the network, and $d(u_i)$, $d(v_j)$ be the source and target degrees of a node pair, respectively.
A good approximation of the edge prior is given by the following:
\begin{equation}
    P_{i,j} = \frac{d(u_i) d(v_j)}{\sqrt{(d(u_i) d(v_j))^2 + (m - d(u_i) - d(v_j) + 1)^2}}
\end{equation}

Further discussion of this approximate edge prior and an derivation are available in [the supplement](#approx-prior-supp).
