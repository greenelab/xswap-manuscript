### Performance of the algorithm

We find that increasing network density prevents the modified XSwap algorithm from removing certain edges.

![Percent of edges swapped vs number of attempts at edge swaps. "Density" here means the number of edges divided the number of node pairs or "potential edges".](https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-analysis/raw/2e173fc5cd21f3958617c7d10ab5cae48dfad1c9/img/6_xswap_percent_swapped_iterations/lines_continuous.png){#fig:swap-percent width="85%"}

<!-- Need another plot with this, but basically what effect degree is having on whether an edge gets switched or not. -->

<!-- Make above plot but with asymptotic value relative to degree. Could be part B to above part A. -->

<!-- Network density vs (fractional) attempts to 50% (or some cutoff) changed -->
<!-- Is it possible to estimate the fraction of the random graph space that is being explored by XSwap? -->
<!-- Is there a closed-form solution for the probability of an edge after a certain number of swaps? -->
<!-- Other methods to get similar results? Chung-Lu, "configuration model"? etc. -->

### Link prediction features

In the table that follows, let $k(u)$ denote the set of neighbors of node $u$.
Let $\mathbf{A}$ represent the normalized Laplacian adjacency matrix, and let $y_u$ be a vector with all ones except for a one in the $u$-th position.
$x$
For a directed graph, let $A(u)$ denote the set of nodes that node $u$ points to and $D(u)$ the set of nodes that point to $u$.
All definitions that follow are the score between nodes $u$ and $v$.
