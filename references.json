    "abstract": "  Compressed bitmap indexes are used in systems such as Git or Oracle to accelerate queries. They represent sets and often support operations such as unions, intersections, differences, and symmetric differences. Several important systems such as Elasticsearch, Apache Spark, Netflix's Atlas, LinkedIn's Pinot, Metamarkets' Druid, Pilosa, Apache Hive, Apache Tez, Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services and Apache Kylin rely on a specific type of compressed bitmap index called Roaring. We present an optimized software library written in C implementing Roaring bitmaps: CRoaring. It benefits from several algorithms designed for the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) instructions available on commodity processors. In particular, we present vectorized algorithms to compute the intersection, union, difference and symmetric difference between arrays. We benchmark the library against a wide range of competitive alternatives, identifying weaknesses and strengths in our software. Our work is available under a liberal open-source license. ",

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, we are experiencing a rapid growth of the number of social-based online systems. The availability of the vast amounts of data gathered in those systems brings new challenges that we face when trying to analyse it. One of the intensively researched topics is the<jats:italic>prediction of social connections between users</jats:italic>. Although a lot of effort has been made to develop new prediction approaches, the existing methods are not comprehensively analysed. In this paper we investigate the correlation between network metrics and accuracy of different prediction methods. We selected six time-stamped real-world social networks and ten most widely used link prediction methods. The results of the experiments show that the performance of some methods has a strong correlation with certain network metrics. We managed to distinguish “prediction friendly” networks, for which most of the prediction methods give good performance, as well as “prediction unfriendly” networks, for which most of the methods result in high prediction error. Correlation analysis between network metrics and prediction accuracy of prediction methods may form the basis of a metalearning system where based on network characteristics it will be able to recommend the right prediction method for a given network.</jats:p>",

The degree-weighted behaviour is manifested throughout the protein-protein interaction networks studied here, except for the high-degree, or hub, interaction areas. However, we find that the probabilities of interaction between the hubs are still high. Further evidence is provided by path length analyses, which show that these hubs are separated by very few links.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The results suggest that protein-protein interaction networks incorporate probabilistic elements that lead to scale-rich hierarchical architectures. These observations seem to be at odds with a biologically-guided organization. One interpretation of the findings is that we are witnessing the ability of proteins to indiscriminately bind rather than the protein-protein interactions that are actually utilized by the cell in biological processes. Therefore, the topological study of a degree-weighted network requires a more refined methodology to extract biological information about pathways, modules, or other inferred relationships among proteins.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Rxivist uses a custom web crawler to index all papers on biorxiv.org; this is a snapshot of Rxivist the production database. The version number indicates the date on which the snapshot was taken. See the included \"README.md\" file for instructions on how to use the \"rxivist.backup\" file to import data into a PostgreSQL database server.\n\nPlease note this is a different repository than the one used for the Rxivist manuscript—that is in a separate Zenodo repository. You're welcome (and encouraged!) to use this data in your research, but <strong>please cite our paper, available on bioRxiv.</strong>\n\nGoing forward, this information will also be available pre-loaded into Docker images, available at blekhmanlab/rxivist_data.\n\n<strong>Version notes:</strong>\n\n\n\t<strong>2019-03-21</strong>\n\n\t\n\t\tThe license for this dataset has been changed to CC-BY, which allows use for any purpose and requires only attribution.\n\t\tA new table, \"publication_dates,\" has been added and will be continually updated. This table will include an entry for each preprint that has been published externally for which we can determine a date of publication, based on data from Crossref. (This table was previously included in the \"paper\" schema but was not updated after early December 2018.)\n\t\tForeign key constraints have been added to almost every table in the database. This should not impact any read behavior, but anyone writing to these tables will encounter constraints on existing fields that refer to other tables. Most frequently, this means the \"article\" field in a table will need to refer to an ID that actually exists in the \"articles\" table.\n\t\tThe \"author_translations\" table has been removed. This was used to redirect incoming requests for outdated author profile pages and was likely not of any functional use to others.\n\t\tThe \"README.md\" file has been renamed \"1README.md\" because Zenodo only displays a preview for the file that appears first in the list alphabetically.\n\t\tThe \"article_ranks\" and \"article_ranks_working\" tables have been removed as well; they were unused.\n\t\n\t\n\t<strong>2019-02-13.1</strong>\n\t\n\t\tAfter consultation with bioRxiv, the \"fulltext\" table will not be included in further snapshots until (and if) concerns about licensing and copyright can be resolved.\n\t\tThe \"docker-compose.yml\" file was added, with corresponding instructions in the README to streamline deployment of a local copy of this database.\n\t\n\t\n\t<strong>2019-02-13</strong>\n\t\n\t\tThe redundant \"paper\" schema has been removed.\n\t\tBioRxiv has begun making the full text of preprints available online. Beginning with this version, a new table (\"fulltext\") is available that contains the text of preprints that have been processed already. <strong>The format in which this information is stored may change in the future</strong>; any digression will be noted here.\n\t\tThis is the first version that has a corresponding Docker image.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The growth of preprints in the life sciences has been reported widely and is driving policy changes for journals and funders, but little quantitative information has been published about preprint usage. Here, we report how we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. The rate of preprint uploads to bioRxiv continues to grow (exceeding 2,100 in October 2018), as does the number of downloads (1.1 million in October 2018). We also find that two-thirds of preprints posted before 2017 were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and find a relationship between the number of downloads a preprint has received and the impact factor of the journal in which it is published. We also describe Rxivist.org, a web application that provides multiple ways to interact with preprint metadata.</jats:p>",
